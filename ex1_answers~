Consider the following code (draw a flowchart diagram if it helps):
if x>2:
if y>2:
z=x+y
print "z is ",z
else:
print "x is ",x
What is the output if:
a.
b.
c.
d.
x = 2 and y = 5? =2 
x = 3 and y = 1?= Nothing
x = 1 and y = 1?=1
x = 4 and y = 3?=7


2. Suppose we have the following code:
z = x+3
if z==1:
y=0
elif z==2:
y=10
elif z==4:
y+=1
else:
y=1
a. What is y equal to at after the switch statem
 Y=1

b. What if x = 2 and y = 5 at the beginning?
Y=1

3. What does the following code output, and how many times do we run through the loop
body?
i=0
while i < 10:
i+=1
if i%2 == 0:
print i

The output will be 2 4 6 8 10
we will run through the code 10 times

4. How about this version of the code?
while i > 10:
i+=1
if i%2 == 0:
print i

This will give an error because i is not defined
